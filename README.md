# Magnetar

Magnetar is aimed at being a web client that can communicate to a web api.

The main goal is to eliminate the use of lots and lots of support tools (which has sort of reached the point of overwhelming a developer) to get a simple task done but enable a developer to build SPAs in a cleaner and less stressful way. By doing so making it easier to get on with the actual development.

Magnetar provides following fundamentals that you need to kickstart your SPA project.

 - JWT support
 - Session support
 - PubSub to handle user defined events
 - Request to deal with communicating with the server (And yes! it can upload files)
 - Router to load and unload modules and to navigate around
 - Validator to validate forms
 - Additional Helper functions
 - Header, Sidenav and Login module already in place

Enjoy!
